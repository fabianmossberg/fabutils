# FabUtils

Just code I seem to need again from time to time.

## Strings to numbers

Converts strings to numbers, pretty decently. I use it to normalize inputs pasted from OCR-scanning receipts, copy/pasting from emails etc.

## Format name

A utillity to case-format names. Focuses on Swedish names.

## Delay

Wait for x milliseconds before continuing.

## Format emails

Convert emails to lowercase and trims them.
